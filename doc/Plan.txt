INPUT:	-The absolute path of the folder for music files to be changed
	-The name of the output folder
	
OUTPUT:	-Moved Files into folders with the corresponding artist and album folder with the metadata updated
	-An output file giving the success status of each file that was changed (or not)


Steps:
-Start with a directory with files that will be edited and moved inside it.
-Run
-Ask for absolute path of the directory with the files that will be edited
-Ask for the name of the output folder

-Create the output folder with the three subfolders that are based on success
-Create the output status file in the root of the output folder

-Get the list of files that will be modified in that directory
-Loop through each file recursively, ignoreing the files in the specified output directory
	-Determine the available tags
	-Determine if the relavent information is available or not
		=If the relavent information is not there, this should be recorded in the output file
	-Pull the video information and put it in the comment tag (Uploader, upload date, original information)
	-Keep track of the success status

	
	-Write out the success status of the file to the output file
	-Based on the success status, move the file to the apropriate folder (Complete success, partial, failure)
		-Check if the artist/album directory already exists
			-If it does, move the file into that directory
			-If it doesn't, create the directory and move the file



For the consideration of complete success:
	-Title
	-Artist
	-Album
	-Date
	-Comments

Partial:
	-Some data was found in the description, but not all
Failure:
	-No data could be found in the description and the title could not be parsed based on a guess




JSON format:
[
	{"filename": "name",
	"successStatus": "complete"
	},
	{}
]
